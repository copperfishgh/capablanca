# Capablanca - Chess Tactical Analysis Companion

**Capablanca** is a real-time chess analysis tool designed to catch blunders and tactical oversights while you focus on strategy. It's not a chess engine opponent or referee - it's your tactical safety net.

## What Capablanca Does

Capablanca watches your chess games and uses minimal lookahead analysis to:

- ✅ **Warn about blunders** - "That move hangs your queen"
- ✅ **Spot missed opportunities** - "You can win a rook with Rxd7"
- ✅ **Prevent basic mistakes** - "Your king will be in check"
- ✅ **Count material** - "Free pawn on e5"
- ✅ **Catch simple tactics** - Forks, pins, skewers in 1-2 moves

## What Capablanca Doesn't Do

- ❌ **Strategic evaluation** - No positional judgment or long-term planning
- ❌ **Deep calculation** - No extensive move tree searching
- ❌ **Play against you** - Not a chess opponent
- ❌ **Opening/endgame theory** - Focus is purely tactical

## The Philosophy

> *"Let me handle the strategy, you handle the blunders."*

Chess has two main components: **tactical accuracy** (not hanging pieces) and **strategic understanding** (planning, position evaluation). Most players want to develop their strategic thinking, but simple tactical oversights ruin games. Capablanca handles the tactical bookkeeping so you can focus on the strategic art of chess.

- **Optional**: NumPy for enhanced sound generation

For technical architecture and development details, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Analysis System Design

Capablanca separates chess analysis into two distinct helper categories with **granular user control**:

### Helper Selection Interface
**Checkbox panel to the right of the chess board:**
- Individual checkboxes for each tactical and strategic helper
- Only checked helpers are active in analysis
- Settings persist across program sessions (saved to config file)
- Allows progressive learning and customized experience

**UI Layout:**
```

### 🔴 Tactical Helpers (Checkbox Controlled)
**Visual annotations directly on the chess board:**

**Hanging Pieces (Implemented):**
- Clear visual indicators with consistent border thickness for all pieces
- Red borders for your hanging pieces (danger), green for opponent's (opportunity)
- Consistent 4px border thickness - piece value is obvious from the piece itself
- Player-perspective colors that work correctly with board flipping

**Exchange Evaluation (Implemented):**
- Yellow triangle indicators mark tactically interesting pieces that can be captured
- Hover investigation shows orange highlighting of all attacking and defending pieces
- Human-evaluated tactical analysis without computer calculation
- High-performance caching system prevents lag during mouse movement
- Integrated with hanging pieces system for complete tactical awareness

**Implemented Tactical Helpers:**
- **Pins** - Detects both absolute pins (to king) and relative pins (to valuable pieces)
- **Skewers** - Identifies high-value pieces attacked with lower-value pieces behind (excludes pawns)
- **X-ray Attacks** - Shows all attackers including those behind other pieces on the same line

**Future Tactical Helpers:**
- **Immediate Threats** - Warning symbols for mate in 1, checks
- **Simple Tactics** - Highlight forks and discovered attacks
- **Material Wins** - Show squares where you can capture for free
- **Blunder Prevention** - Block moves that hang material

**Drag-and-Drop System (Implemented):**
- **Smooth Piece Movement**: Click and drag pieces with automatic square snapping
- **Real-time Preview**: As you drag over legal squares, see tactical consequences instantly
- **Performance Optimized**: Annotations only recalculate when entering different legal destinations
- **Visual Feedback**: Piece centers itself in current square, legal moves highlighted
- **Complete Integration**: Works seamlessly with all helpers and board flipping

**Move Preview System (Implemented):**
- **Preview Board State**: Creates temporary board state with candidate move executed
- **Real-time Helper Updates**: Hanging pieces indicators update to show post-move position
- **Complete Tactical Awareness**: See which pieces would be hanging after your move before committing

*Critical alerts that prevent immediate material loss or checkmate*

### 🔵 Strategic Helpers (Optional Checkbox)
**Text analysis panel under the board:**

**Pawn Structure Analysis:**
- **Weak Pawns** - Isolated, backward, doubled pawns
- **Pawn Breaks** - Suggest pawn advances like c5 to challenge center
- **Passed Pawns** - Identify advancement opportunities

**Positional Features:**
- **Open Files** - Available files for rook placement
- **Outpost Squares** - Strong squares protected by pawns, unreachable by enemy pawns
- **Piece Coordination** - Suggestions for better piece placement

**Example Strategic Output:**
```
Strategic Analysis:
• Backward pawn on d6 needs attention - consider c5 break
• Open g-file available for your rook
• Knight outpost available on e5 square
• Weak kingside pawn structure after h6
```

## Vision: The Perfect Chess Assistant

**Tactical Layer:** *"STOP! That hangs your queen!"* (Red board annotation)
**Strategic Layer:** *"Consider: Open d-file available"* (Blue text suggestion)

You make the strategic decisions. Capablanca prevents the tactical oversights and suggests positional improvements.
