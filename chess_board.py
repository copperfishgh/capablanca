Chess Board State Module

This module provides a wrapper around python-chess library with helper methods
for tactical analysis and game statistics.

Uses python-chess types directly:
- chess.Piece (piece type + color)
- chess.Square (0-63 integer)
- chess.WHITE/BLACK (boolean True/False)
- chess.PAWN/KNIGHT/BISHOP/ROOK/QUEEN/KING (integers 1-6)
